### What is Sustainability?
The million dollar question. Believe it or not, there is no formal definition of sustainability. However, the use of the word has evolved from environmental matters to include an array of themes from human rights and diversity to corporate ethics and governance.

At Sustainability Matters, I'm not simply talking about recycling; I'm writing about a range of environmental, social and governance topics. Sustainability here takes its cue from the UN World Commission on Environment and Development and the Principles for Responsible Investment. Hence, you will see diverse topics such as labor issues, privacy and information security, diversity, food security, health care, corporate ethics, climate, among others, being covered in this site.

Indeed, the breadth of what is considered a sustainability issue can be overwhelming, while the scope of some topics can be complex. My mission is to bring these issues to you in a way that is simple and easy to understand. I strongly believe that everybody has a stake in a sustainable and just world, and knowing about these issues is a step towards taking concrete action.
